This is Ulight browser. A lightweight browser that comes by default on Puppy Linux. The original project exists on https://sourceforge.net/projects/lightfirefox/ . This is a i386 build of Light browser. Should work on most 64 bit OS. But if it does not, you can always build manually from source.

***A word of advice***

**This browser is lightweight, and probably a bit outdated. Which means, it probably has some security flaws according to modern web standards. I suggest not to use this browser for anything relating to logins or credentials. Especially on a Public netowrk, because, Ulight doesn't implement tls verison 1.3, I think it implements tls 1.2. Normal web browsing is fine though. Nevertheless, if you must, I suggest using Dnscrypt proxy(https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy) or anything that encrypts your traffic along with it. At least it'll cloak you from local man in the middle attacks. I think in general it's always better to have encrypted traffic rather than none, especially when you're on a public network.**
